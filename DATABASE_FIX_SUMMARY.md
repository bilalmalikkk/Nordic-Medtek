# Database Fix - Missing rich_text Column

## 🐛 Issue
When clicking the "Update Product" button in the admin panel, nothing happened and the following error appeared in the console:

```
SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: rich_text
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The database schema file (`schema.sql`) defined a `rich_text` column for the products table, but the actual database file (`cms.db`) was missing this column. This mismatch occurred because:

1. The database was created before the `rich_text` column was added to the schema
2. No migration was run to add the column to existing databases

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added Missing Column to Database
```sql
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN rich_text TEXT;
```

This command was executed directly on the database to add the missing column.

### 2. Updated Migration File
Updated `src/cms/database/migration.sql` to include the fix for future reference.

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed logging in the database update function to help diagnose similar issues in the future.

## 📋 Verification Steps

To verify the fix worked, run:

```bash
cd "E:\Mikal\Nordic Medical Technologies\nordic-medtek\src\cms\database"
sqlite3 cms.db ".schema products"
```

You should now see `rich_text TEXT` in the schema output.

## 🧪 Testing

1. Start the application: `npm run dev:full`
2. Go to the admin panel
3. Click "Edit" on any product
4. Make changes
5. Click "💾 Update Product"
6. The product should now update successfully!

## 📊 Current Database Schema

The products table now has all required columns:

**Basic Information:**
- `id` - Primary key
- `title` - Display title
- `product_name` - Product name (required)
- `item_number` - Unique item number (required)
- `slug` - URL-friendly slug

**Descriptions:**
- `technical_data` - Technical specifications
- `rich_text_description` - Plain text description
- `rich_text` - HTML content ✅ **FIXED**

**Media:**
- `image_url` - Product image URL
- `pdf_url` - Additional PDF URL
- `datasheet_url` - Product datasheet URL

**Organization:**
- `category_id` - Category reference
- `collection_id` - Collection reference
- `sorting` - Sort order
- `manual_sort` - Manual sorting field

**Status & Publishing:**

- `is_featured` - Featured product flag
- `publish_date` - Publishing date
- `unpublish_date` - Unpublishing date

**Metadata:**
- `external_id` - Original external ID
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## 🚀 What's Working Now
