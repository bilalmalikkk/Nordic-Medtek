# 🚀 START HERE - Database Persistence Fix

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Your database changes were reverting because **the database file was in Git**. Every code push overwrote your production database with old local data.

**This is now FIXED!** But you need to do ONE thing before deploying:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Configure Railway Volume (REQUIRED!)

### Option A: Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Open your project
3. Click on your service
4. **Settings** → **Volumes** → **+ New Volume**
5. Mount path: `/app/src/cms/database`
6. Click **Add**

### Option B: Railway CLI

```bash
railway volume create --mount-path /app/src/cms/database
```

⚠️ **DO THIS BEFORE DEPLOYING OR YOUR DATABASE WILL BE WIPED!**

---

## ✅ Step 2: Deploy the Fix

```bash
# Commit the fix (already staged and ready!)
git commit -m "Fix: Remove database from git tracking"

# Push to Railway
git push origin main
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Test It Works

1. **Edit a product** in production admin panel
2. **Push any code change** (even just a comment)
3. **Check the product** → Your edit should still be there! ✅
